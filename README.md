Gem (previously called Editor) is a performant and simple plain text editor, created with Prosemirror. The design is very inpsired by Paco Coursey's ["Writer"](https://github.com/pacocoursey/writer).

The goods:

- Fairly lightweight, around 65.5 kB for the whole website.
  - Can do a fair bit better here...some of the prosemirror modules can be stripped for this purpose.
- Undo/redo.
- Arrow key movement.
- Basic inline markdown (bold, code, italic), although they can be a little buggy.
- JS source is small and readable.
- CSS source is small and readable. Uses CSS variables for styling.
- Accessible and semantic. Each paragraph becomes a `p` tag, each inline style is appropriately represented.
- Playful animated cursor :)

To run: `npm run dev`. The build step uses `estrella` to bundle/watch and `serve` for serving.

To do (in priority):

- Switch to using codemirror so that syntax highlighting becomes easier to dispatch
- Basic markdown syntax highlighting.
  - Headings
  - Bullet lists
  - Numbered lists
  - Code block
- Code block syntax highlighting (async loading through prismjs?)
- Cursor shape changes when marks are applied (fatter when bold, slant when italic, rectangle when code)
- Default word-selection (when you start highlighting, it defaults to selecting the whole word your cursor is on).
- Fix sentence-wrapping bug where it overflows sometimes (unreproducible as of yet, unless you paste in a huge text).
- Highlight and animate selection through 3 divs: one on bottom to beginning of line, one sandwiched in b/w, and one from top to end of line
- "Bookmarks" to leave your cursor in a position and travel back to.

Things I'm thinking of adding:

- Table of contents generated from the headings for easy navigation?
- Tree-sitter for incremental markdown parsing? Prosemirror plugin to wrap the wasm bundle?
- Allow theming/setting the color variables in UI?
- Potentially replace prosemirror-view to be more lightweight and integrate cursor and selection "natively"?
- Share urls to save?
